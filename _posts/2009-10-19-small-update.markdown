Since the migration to wordpress, nothing new published. Maybe the biggest hiatus since I started blogging.

In a nutshell :

<h3>Stopped smoking</h3>
114 days since last smoke. Feeling good about it. Saved around 500â‚¬.

<h3>Got the new Toyota Prius</h3>
If you're looking for a comfortable, silent, geeky (but with a family) car, that's the one. Fuel economy is the same as ye ole' Twingo but with twice the horsepower and twice the number of doors. And no manual shifting. 

<h3>Getting prepped for the new baby</h3>
The boy (yes, another boy) is expected within a month.

<h3>Martin</h3>
Cute <strong>and</strong> funny: check
Speech: check
iPhone skills: check
Scribblenauts skills: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2E7b9ME0t8">check</a>

<h3>Work related stuff</h3>
Now playing with Drupal. Very interesting, and making good use of PHP.
I do quite lot a Javascript.
It's the most important language nowadays. And it should be learnt as soon as possible. 

Protip : use and peruse Douglas Crockford's <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/0596517742?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=csblo-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1642&amp;creative=19458&amp;creativeASIN=0596517742">Javascript: the Good Parts</a>

The French version is also <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/2744023280?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=csblo-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1642&amp;creative=19458&amp;creativeASIN=2744023280">available</a>.

Still have quite a lot of erlang to write, and it's still very enjoyable.

<h3>Upcoming</h3>
I will "review" the Prius (in French) someday.

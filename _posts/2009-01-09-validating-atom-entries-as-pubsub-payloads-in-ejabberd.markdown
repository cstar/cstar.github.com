title: Validating Atom entries as PubSub payloads in ejabberd
---
<p>Small bit of code to validate Atom when in xmlelement tuples.</p>

<p>Written for the pubsub component of ejabberd, integration to follow shortly.</p>

<p>Not perfect yet, but should still be useful. Patches appreciated.</p>

<p>Should have full EUnit coverage too.</p>

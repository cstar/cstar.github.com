Thatâ€™s collaborative music composition in a fully featured sequencer, with some innovative features.

My part is the real-time stuff and storage, and that's where ejabberd comes in with some custom OTP applications and redis. Amazon Web Services are also an important part of the setup.

I'll certainly write more on the topic regarding the technical stuff.

So now the cat is out of the bag, hope you like it.

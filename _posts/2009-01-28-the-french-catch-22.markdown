title: The French catch-22

<h1>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_22">catch-22</a></h1>

<ul>
<li>The right to strike is in the Constition.</li>
<li>When you&#8217;re on strike, the law says you are supposed to be at the office. Not working but in the right location.</li>
<li>Given that public transportation is on strike, it is impossible to go to your office.</li>
<li>Hence you are not on strike.</li>
<li>That means that you should go to your office for working.</li>
</ul>

<p>Right ?</p>

<h1>The solution</h1>

<p>Take a day off. You&#8217;re French, you have many of them.</p>

<h1>OK, that whole post is stupid.</h1>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h1>Also this is cute</h1>

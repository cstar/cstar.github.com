<a href="http://twitter.com/cstar/status/7037325384">See here !</a>

I am a bit disappointed on insert times (twice slower than dets), but I could have a plan.

It's been great fun and I learnt a lot on both Riak <em>and</em> Redis.

<a href="http://gist.github.com/261670#file_riak_redis_backend.erl">The gist is here</a> â€” though it now deserves to migrate to a full size github project.

Later, after foie gras, salmon and fine French wine I might dissect the approach to the code, and my plan !

Merry Christmas !

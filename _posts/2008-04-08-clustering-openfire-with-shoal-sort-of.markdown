title: Clustering OpenFire with Shoal (Sort of ...)
---
<p>As requested <a href="http://www.igniterealtime.org/community/blogs/ignite/2008/04/07/turning-openfire-enterprise-into-an-open-source-product">there</a>, the code I wrote for clustering OpenFire with Shoal.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not functional. The cluster lifecycle is ok. Getting Synchronous and Asynchronous tasks running on the cluster work within MUC.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s still a lot of work. </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t plan working on this code any further, but if it can inspire someone in carrying it on &#8230;</p>
